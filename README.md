# zine + Sonic Reducer TodoMVC Example

This is a TodoMVC implementation intended to illustrate the use of [zine](https://github.com/j-s-n/zine) and [Sonic Reducer](https://github.com/j-s-n/sonic-reducer).

It's a work in progress, and probably isn't fully compliant with the official [TodoMVC project](http://todomvc.com/) guidelines yet.

The final output is compiled from ES6 sources in `src/`. Check out `src/store.js` for an example of one way to build a reactive store using Sonic Reducer's atoms, and check out `src/app.js` to see how easy it is to connect an atomic store up to a view built from React components.
